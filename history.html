                        <h3>Early Days</h3>
                        <p>The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) was founded in 1993 as a platform to identify the
                            most effective martial art in a contest with minimal rules between competitors of different
                            fighting disciplines. It has since evolved into a more balanced sport with well-rounded
                            fighters practicing various forms of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, wrestling, Muay Thai, boxing, and
                            other martial arts.</p>

                        <h3>Mainstream Acceptance</h3>
                        <p>For many years, UFC struggled to gain mainstream acceptance. It faced various legal and
                            regulatory challenges, but the tide started to turn in the early 2000s, particularly after
                            Zuffa, LLC, purchased the organization in 2001. Major regulatory bodies started sanctioning
                            the events, and a new set of unified rules helped legitimize the sport.</p>

                            McGregor, Ronda Rousey, and Khabib Nurmagomedov, the sport has captured the global audience.
                            UFC events are now some of the most-watched sporting events worldwide, with a strong social
                            media following and lucrative sponsorship and broadcast deals.</p>

                        <h3>Conor McGregor</h3>
                        <p>Conor McGregor, known as "The Notorious", is one of the most iconic figures in UFC
                            history.
                            Hailing from Dublin, Ireland, McGregor's charisma, both inside and outside the Octagon,
                            has
                            made him a global superstar.</p>
                        <p>In 2016, McGregor achieved what no other fighter in UFC history had accomplished: he
                            became
                            the first fighter to hold two UFC titles simultaneously. He won the featherweight title
                            by
                            defeating Jos√© Aldo in just 13 seconds and later captured the lightweight title with a
                            victory over Eddie Alvarez.</p>

                            <h3>Women in UFC</h3>
                            <p>Ronda Rousey shattered multiple glass ceilings when she became the first woman to sign
                                with the UFC. An Olympic judo bronze medalist, Rousey transitioned to mixed martial arts
                                and quickly became a dominant force. Her first twelve fights all ended in first-round
                                victories, showcasing her exceptional grappling skills and finishing abilities.</p>
                            <p>As the inaugural UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion, Rousey defended her title six times
                                before eventually suffering a defeat. Her popularity transcended the sport, attracting
                                new audiences and bringing attention to women's MMA. Even after her UFC career, Rousey
                                continues to be an influential figure in sports and entertainment, contributing
                                significantly to the acceptance and success of women's divisions in mixed martial arts.

                            <h3>The Fertitta Era</h3>
                            <p>In 2001, Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta, along with their high-school friend Dana White,
                                bought the UFC for $2 million. At the time, the organization was stigmatized and
                                struggling to find mainstream acceptance. However, the Fertittas and White saw the
                                untapped potential and committed to elevating the sport to new heights.</p>
                            <p>Under their leadership, the UFC underwent significant transformations, from rule changes
                                to better promotion, that made it palatable for a broader audience. The era was marked
                                by landmark deals with television networks and the explosion of pay-per-view buys. By
                                the time they sold the UFC in 2016 for $4 billion, they had turned it into one of the
                                fastest-growing sports organizations globally. Their stewardship is considered a
                                revolutionary chapter in the sport's history.</p>
